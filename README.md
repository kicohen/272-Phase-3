# Chess Store Project: Phase 3
## 67-272 Application Design and Development
### Kenny Cohen

### Expected Code Errors:
* Controllers Test: There should be 3 errors on the contact, privacy, and about controllers that are "Expected response to be a <success>, but was <302>" This is because the contact, privacy, and about pages all exist on the home page.
* Cucumber Tests: There should be 1 failure and 5 skipped steps. It should be the "View Reorder List" scenario. This is because my home page is meant as a website home page for all users rather than just the admin site.
